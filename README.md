# Rumbl

This project is used to play videos that are hosted in other platforms. At the
same time, users can attach comments in real-time! It's being developed while
reading through [Programming Phoenix 1.4](https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4),
but it's not yet finished, as the framework's current version generates a
different assets structure than described by the book, and I didn't manage to
make the video player work.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
